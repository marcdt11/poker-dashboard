### Features (Future)
_(none planned)_

### Bugs
_(none known)_

### Tech Debt
- Password hardcoded in source — fine for now, but not real auth
- CORS proxy dependency — if all three proxies go down, dashboard breaks

### Tech Debt
- Single-file architecture will need splitting if app grows significantly
